This solution has working code with the NuGets it has installed. When you run it and create a new Cloq Entity by calling POST /api/cloq/{name} it log every time Tick() is called (it'll schedule to be called after 5 seconds, but sometimes it can take longer). 

To Reproduce the bug, upgrade the Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask NuGet package to 2.4.0 (which is currently the latest version). 
If you try the same as before, you will notice it will no longer log about Tick(). If you wait for a little while (never takes longer than 1 minute) it will log about something else running, and it will do this more often than the expected 5 seconds.
